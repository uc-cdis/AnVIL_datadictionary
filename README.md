# AnVIL Data Dictionary

The [AnVIL](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL) data dictionary (https://gen3.theanvil.io/dd) provides the first level of validation for genomic data and clinical elements managed by the NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL). 

AnVIL is a scalable and interoperable resource for the genomic scientific community, that leverages a cloud-based infrastructure for democratizing genomic data access, sharing and computing across large genomic, and genomic-related data sets. 

The general structure and concepts derive from the [GDC Data Dictionary](https://github.com/nci-gdc/gdcdictionary). Written in YAML, JSON schemas define all the individual entities (nodes) in the data model and define all of the relationships (links) between the nodes. These schemas define valid key-value pairs that can be used to describe the nodes.

## Datasets

### [CCDG](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Common-Disease-Genomics)
The Centers for Common Disease Genomics are a collaborative large-scale genome sequencing effort to comprehensively identify rare risk and protective variants contributing to multiple common disease phenotypes.

### [CMG](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Mendelian-Genomics-CMG)
The Centers for Mendelian Genomics is a multi-center collaboration aimed at identifying the genes responsible for Mendelian phenotypes by whole exome and whole genome sequencing

### [GTEx](https://gtexportal.org/home/)
The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq.

### [1000 G](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
The 1000 Genomes Project, launched in January 2008, is an international research effort to establish variation profiles across the human population. This open access data set continues to be a valuable resource to geneticists.

### [eMERGE](https://emerge-network.org/)
The Electronic and MEdical Records and Genomics project (eMERGE) is a national network organized and funded by the NHGRI that combines DNA biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for large scale, high-throughput genetic research in support of implementing genomic medicine.
